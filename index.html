            <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-600 font-medium mb-6">(And What We Can Learn About Growing Up and Reinventing Ourselves)</h2>
            <p class="text-lg">Remember that magical summer of '82 when an alien with a glowing finger stole our hearts? When Steven Spielberg's E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial burst onto screens, it didn't just break box office records—it made overnight celebrities of its young cast. But after the bicycles landed and the spaceships departed, what paths did these actors take?</p>
            <p class="text-lg mt-4">Their journeys might surprise you—and they just might hold the secret to why reinvention isn't just for Hollywood stars, but for smart businesses too.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">The boy who befriended an alien became a household name overnight. But Henry Thomas took an unexpected route after his tearful goodbye to E.T. While he continued acting in films like Legends of the Fall, Thomas deliberately stepped away from the blinding spotlight, choosing character-driven roles over blockbuster fame. These days, you might recognize him from Netflix's chilling The Haunting of Hill House series—proof that sometimes the most fulfilling path isn't always the most obvious one.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">That pigtailed little girl who screamed at the sight of E.T.? She transformed her early stardom into an empire. But Drew's journey wasn't written like a fairytale—it included well-documented struggles, reinventions, and comebacks that would make even Hollywood scriptwriters raise their eyebrows. From child actress to producer, director, beauty mogul, and beloved talk show host, Drew's career proves that evolution isn't just possible—it's essential.</p>

            <p class="mt-6">Remember Elliott's protective older brother? After E.T., Robert MacNaughton appeared in a handful of projects before making a decision that would baffle many Hollywood insiders—he traded scripts for a steady career as a mail handler with the U.S. Postal Service. In an industry obsessed with fame, MacNaughton chose stability and satisfaction over the limelight, finding his own definition of success far from the cameras.</p>
